@ Expand All items in inventory
@ Expand all items in category
@ If the player expand an item stack and then when removing / equipping an item from inventory so that specific type of item (eg Simple Dagger) is no longer existing in the inventory, 
the next time the player loot a Simple Dagger, that item stack will still be expanded. I want to change it so when a "new" item gets added to the inventory, it will always be minimized.
