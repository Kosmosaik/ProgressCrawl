- **Attacks / behavior:** Bites in melee; power attacks from some variants can inflict a disease that reduces weapon or limb effectiveness; many games describe wolves as low‑level but dangerous in packs, circling and attacking from flanks.
- **Attacks / behavior:** Casts healing clouds that restore nearby allies over several seconds; throws poison projectiles that leave lingering damaging clouds; tends to keep distance while allies engage in melee.
- **Attacks / behavior:** Charges and attacks with tusk goring and headbutts; some variants are neutral until attacked, others are fully hostile; has a chance to appear in manhunter packs.

- **Attacks / behavior:** Flee on sight; no offensive abilities.
- **Attacks / behavior:** Fleeing, non‑aggressive; no combat abilities.
- **Attacks / behavior:** Generally non‑hostile; most are farm animals with no combat role.

- **Attacks / behavior:** Headbutt and charge attacks; relatively fast; used as expendable scouts or light base defenders in at least one squad‑based sandbox.
- **Attacks / behavior:** Heavy melee swipes and lunges; some sources emphasize their ability to quickly kill low‑level characters; often solitary but extremely dangerous.
- **Attacks / behavior:** Heavy swipes and mauls at close range; high damage and health; in some RPGs, bears are noted for fast closing speed and high burst damage.
- **Attacks / behavior:** Herbivores mostly flee; carnivores may hunt colonists or livestock; some species can go “manhunter” and attack en masse.
- **Attacks / behavior:** Highly varied; includes breath attacks, aerial dives, tail whips, charge attacks, grabs, projectile vomit/venom, and terrain‑altering moves. Many interact with forest features like vines, ledges and canopy perches.
- **Attacks / behavior:** Hops toward the player and deals contact damage; some versions inflict slow or debuffs.

- **Attacks / behavior:** Melee bite attacks that apply poison over time.
- **Attacks / behavior:** Melee pincer attacks; some variants possess high physical resistance thanks to their shell.

- **Attacks / behavior:** Uses an enormous club and can crush players and structures with wide swings; breaks walls and fences easily, and can hurl players long distances.
- **Attacks / behavior:** Uses heavy melee swings (punches, overhead smashes, ground‑slams with a small area of effect) and can also throw boulders at range; log‑wielding variants perform wide, sweeping log swings and overhead smashes that can hit multiple targets.
- **Attacks / behavior:** Uses heavy melee swings that can knock players back; throws large stones; more resistant to damage than normal variants.
- **Attacks / behavior:** Uses melee claw attacks, can cast nature magic (summoning animals, draining health, or using poison‑like effects) and can temporarily become ethereal or invisible while moving through trees.

- **Known loot:** Wolf pelt or generic “fur” items (convertible to leather), raw meat, animal fat and bones in several systems; some implementations list a guaranteed pelt drop with a small chance of additional minor loot such as gold, gems or a low‑level ring. In at least one block‑building sandbox, forest‑spawning wolves drop no items but award experience orbs.
- **Notes:** Bears and their pelts are commonly associated with advanced leatherworking, warm cloaks and ranger/hunter theming.
- **Notes:** Clearing these slimes repeatedly is one of the documented ways to gather hardwood‑tree seeds from a forest area.
- **Notes:** Considered weaker than dedicated attack animals (like war dogs or bonedog‑type creatures) but cheaper to maintain and replace.
- **Notes:** Eggs and meat are used in early cooking; feathers often feed into arrow and fletching recipes.
- **Notes:** Forest biomes are generally portrayed as highly habitable due to this mix of huntable animals, predators and timber.
- **Notes:** Forest hunts against these monsters are core progression activities, and their materials define multiple full equipment sets.

- **Notes:** High‑priority target in forest fights due to healing and poison.
- **Notes:** In at least one simulation game, documented as appearing specifically in temperate forests where it can be hunted or tamed; boars are generally considered efficient meat/leather sources but inferior to specialized livestock for long‑term husbandry.
- **Notes:** In some colony sims, these animals are mostly used to train hunters or supply minor amounts of food rather than for serious combat or loot.
- **Notes:** In some survival games, crabs bridge coastal and forest biomes, sharing loot tables with other shoreline creatures.
- **Notes:** Often appears during forest attack events, usually accompanied by multiple smaller creatures.
- **Notes:** Often relatively low‑health but dangerous if ignored because of stacking poison.
- **Notes:** Often shares spawn areas with normal boars but yields more valuable resources due to the added rare mineral drops.
- **Notes:** Often targeted primarily for their valuable hides used in mid‑tier armor and saddlery.
- **Notes:** Often the first combat encounter in forested regions of farming‑RPG hybrids.
- **Notes:** Pelts are often valuable trade goods and components for warm armor and cloaks; bears are sometimes linked to ancient forest cults or druidic imagery in lore.
- **Notes:** Pelts are widely used for tanning into leather, basic armor and trophies; in multiple games, wolves can be tamed into companions rather than hunted.
- **Notes:** The mahogany‑seed drop is specifically mentioned in the relevant wiki as a way to obtain hardwood‑tree seeds from a forest combat area.
- **Notes:** These entities round out the temperate‑forest ecosystem in games that blend combat with farming and village life.
- **Notes:** Used as mobile chemfuel producers; managing them near forest structures requires careful fire‑safety planning.
- **Notes:** Usually farmed less for meat and more for fur and rare resource drops in advanced stages of play.

> Aggregated from multiple game wikis. Each entry corresponds to a creature or entity that is documented as appearing in a **temperate forest or forest‑like biome** (broadleaf forests, coniferous forests, forested highlands, etc.). Loot and behavior notes are taken from those wikis and kept as literal as possible.
