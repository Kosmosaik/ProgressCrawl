# ProgressCrawl – Updated Roadmap (0.0.70c → 0.0.70k)
### World Expansion, Zone Content, Events, Interactions, and Persistence
---

## **0.0.70c — World Slot & Template Foundation (Completed)**  
**Goal:** Establish a persistent overworld with deterministic zone generation.

- Seamless world exploration + unlocks after 100% exploration
- Persistent world map saving/loading
- Zone content scaffolding (`zone.content.entities`, `resourceNodes`, `pois`)

### **Deliverable:**  
A stable, persistent overworld ready to host dynamic and static content.

- Persistent POI completion states  

### **Deliverable:**  
POIs become rewarding exploration targets.
