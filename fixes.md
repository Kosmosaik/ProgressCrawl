@ If the player expand an item stack and then when removing / equipping an item from inventory so that specific type of item (eg Simple Dagger) is no longer existing in the inventory, 
the next time the player loot a Simple Dagger, that item stack will still be expanded. I want to change it so when a "new" item gets added to the inventory, it will always be minimized.

@ Make Damage on weapon float value with two decimals (example: Damage 3.37), but only to a certain amount of damage.
When reaching > 10 damage it should only show one decimal, and over 20 it should be flat integers.

@ Max character length on character name (2 Words max and 20 total characters?)

@ Required Skill on equipped weapon shows 0 value in tooltip. Tooltip on inventory item hover works as intended

@ Move Qty so it's right after Item Name in both inventory views.

@ The Leet Power Sword of Doom weapon is not increasing DPS when I increase STR or DEX. Why?

@ When equipping items, the gap/margins between each row of item increases a bit compared with when it just says <empty>.
