# ProgressCrawl – Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the upcoming planned versions of ProgressCrawl.  
It focuses on expanding core gameplay systems in the most logical order, ensuring each new feature builds cleanly on top of existing foundations.

This roadmap is flexible and will evolve as development continues.

---

## v0.0.71 -> 0.0.74 - Polish, Expand & Improve existing systems + Level System

### Planned:
- Add more Biomes and content (resource nodes, pois, entities etc) & expand existing biome (Temperate Forest).
- Add a "Left Hand / Right Hand" system that acts like an early inventory system where the player can only carry
  a limited amount of items until the player has found or crafted a backpack/bag of some sort that unlocks the real inventory.
- Interact / Use system: Combine items and do basic tasks that's not really a fully separate crafting system task:
  (Right click a branch -> Make Lean-To Shelter (blueprint)), (Right Click branch or sticks -> Create Campfire -> Build -> Right click to Add Items -> Raw Meat to cook or wood to make fire), (Right click cooked meat -> Eat, or Drink if water container etc).
  These small interactions will be needed to complete predefined tasks/quests later to introduce the player to the game mechanics.
- Blueprint system for Lean-To Shelter and upcoming camps/constructions. Adds a blueprint to tile/tiles in the zone. When clicking on blueprint you'll see a small window with required items to complete the shelter.
- Hunger & Thirst System
- Eat / Drink System
- Add defense values and other stats to armor/equipment.
- Add all variables, properties/values etc on all items/equipment/character stats in preparation for crafting/gathering and exploring updates. Armor/PDEF, crafting modifier attributes/stats and more.
- Skinning / Butcher and maybe more. Separate resources looted from entities by introducing different skills to get different resources. Skinning = Animal Hide, Butchering = Meat, Bones, Tendons, Teeth or whatever.
  Add these skills as Skills in skill window and separate combat skills from other skills (categorization).
  Later we will implement a "roll system" to increase the grades on the items we will get from performing a skill or do a loot, but for now, let's just roll it randomly directly.
## Skill Leveling System
- Add exp for Skinning, Gathering, Butchering and whatever skills we have implemented.

## v0.0.75 - Quests/Tasks System

### Planned:
- Quest system that first and foremosts define the exploration progress in the Starting Zone. This quests system should be built so it can be reused for randomly generated quests later in other zones.
- Collect x item - Complete - Progress exploration x %
- Add tutorial quests (more predefined)

## v0.0.80 — Combat v1
- Add stats and behavior to entities (HP, Attack, Aggressive/Neutral etc).
- Add a simple combat mechanic/transition (Timer based attacks based on stats).
- Win/Lose mechanics
- Connect Harvest / Loot / Skinning etc

### Planned:
- Simulation-style combat:
  - Player Attack vs Enemy Defense
  - Enemy Attack vs Player HP
  - Attack Speed calculations
  - Sliders for counting down to attack etc
- Loot obtained from defeating enemies, skinning, butchering etc.
- Weapon damage and skill levels fully matter
- Give EXP and skills to weapon, survival and what not.

### UI:
- Combat log
- Enemy card with HP and stats
- Reward screen after victory

---

## v0.0.90 — Gathering System v1
Introduces resource gathering

### Planned:
- Resource items from Resource Node.
- Basic crafting stations (campfire → forge → advanced forge)
- Crafting stats and quality bonuses
- Interactables can require specific tools to gather (Axe to cut down tree etc).
- Timers when player chooses to interact with things in the list (timers for "Walking to X...", "Preparing ....", "Searching for a place to build shelter..." etc). This will make it feel like the character is actually walking around and doing stuff than just instantly interact with everything in the zome.

 - Resource Nodes (Player interacts - get resources from node)
       Resource nodes to add: "Fallen Branch Pile" (gives Twig and Wooden Branch), "Stone Cluster" (gives Small Stone), "Tall Grass Patch" (gives grass bundle and occasionally Plant Fibre), "Tree (Scarred)"(Gives tree bark and insect/bug(find use for it)", "Tree (Normal), gives wood log, woodern branch and           twigs (needs an axe for cutting down tree to get logs).
  - Resource Node grade (F0 -> S9). This will determine what grade the items will get (no longer rolling random grades on item. It will be decided based on grade when player finishes the gathering for that node".
  - Loot tables/pools for every resource node
- Gathering System: Player click on Resource Node -> Clicks on "Get resources" -> System calculates/rolling success or fail to improve grade. When x amount of fails hits -> Give resources to player (or you can choose to "finish now" and get current grade resources).

### UI:
- Gathering screen (Skill of gathering task (Digging, Foraging, Mining whatever), Knowledge of resource, loading screen/slider, current grade, max grade of node etc).
- List to keep all discovered resource nodes, entities, POIs etc that the player will interact with. When depleted, killed or interacted with, remove that from list etc.
