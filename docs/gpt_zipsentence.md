I have uploaded a ZIP. Extract it, then recursively open the full contents of every .js, .md, and .css file in all folders and subfolders, 
and load all lines into your working memory before doing any analysis. 
Two of the files are summary .md files written to guide your understanding of the project (ProgressCrawl_Technical_Roadmap.md and ProgressCrawl_Technical_Summary.md) — read those files first and treat them as the authoritative overview for the entire project.
