I have uploaded a ZIP. Extract it, then recursively open the full contents of every .js, .md, and .css file in all folders and subfolders, 
and load all lines into your working memory before doing any analysis. 
One of the files is a summary .md file written to guide your understanding of the project — read that file first and treat it as the authoritative overview for the entire project.
