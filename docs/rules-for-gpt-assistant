## Project Rules (Do Not Break)

- Zone templates define layout only (no difficulty baked in).
- World tiles own difficultyRating (numeric, 1–10+).
- Spawn tables NEVER generate difficulty.
- Use SPAWN_TABLES.byContext for procedural content.
- Use SPAWN_TABLES.byTemplate only for handcrafted exceptions.
- Do NOT introduce template IDs with difficulty in the name.
- All content population must go through initializeZoneContent().
- Persistence must be delta-based (no regenerating player-changed content).

Tutorial zones are handcrafted exceptions and do not follow normal procedural rules.
