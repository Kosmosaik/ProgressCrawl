# ProgressCrawl Documentation Entry Point

## Recommended Reading Order (For Devs / GPT Assistants)

1. `docs/WORKING_RULES.md` (non-negotiable constraints)
2. `docs/ROADMAP.md` (single source of planning truth)
3. `docs/Technical_Summary.md` (what exists in code today)
4. `docs/M0_Architecture_Implementation_Spec.md` (if M0 work is ongoing)

Then consult system specs as needed:
- `docs/Zone_Refresh_and_Entity_Spawn_v1.md`
- `docs/Combat_System_v1.md`
- `docs/Quality_System_Technical_Summary.md` (Quality system)

## Folder Meanings

- `docs/design/` → Active design/spec docs
- `docs/backlog/` → Backlog notes (not authoritative unless promoted into ROADMAP)
- `docs/ideas/` → Speculative ideas (not authoritative)
- `docs/biomes/` → Biome notes and plans
- `docs/other/` → Optional/auxiliary docs (must stay consistent with ROADMAP)

## Authority Rules

- Planning truth: `docs/ROADMAP.md`
- Implementation truth: `docs/Technical_Summary.md`
- Non-negotiable constraints: `docs/WORKING_RULES.md`
