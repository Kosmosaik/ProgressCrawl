# ProgressCrawl – Technical Summary for Version 0.0.70d
### World Content Generation Systems + Initial Content Population

---

## 0. Overview

This document guides the next GPT assistant in implementing **ProgressCrawl v0.0.70d**, following directly after 0.0.70c.

# Project Purpose & Vision

ProgressCrawl is a long-term survival RPG project that blends:

- Procedural exploration  
- Zone-based progression  
- Crafting / resource systems (future expansions)
- Survival Mechanics (hunger, thirst, disease, injuries)
- Combat / Looting
- Life Skills
- World map navigation  
- Era-based advancement (primitive → fantasy → industrial → sci-fi (by looting puzzle pieces to complete puzzles that unlocks new eras and biomes)  

The player journey is built around **zones**—self-contained maps with unique layouts, challenges, and hidden areas—progressed one tile at a time. The world map ties zones together and represents the player's overland exploration.

The 0.0.70 milestone focuses heavily on **zone exploration**, **procedural generation**, and **locked subregion mechanics**, forming the backbone of future gameplay.
**0.0.70c introduced:**
- World slot templates
- ERA / BIOME / TEMPLATE metadata
- Difficulty system
- Fully deterministic zone generation (seeded CA)
- Adjacency-based world expansion
- Zone Info panel
- Persistence of worldMap
- Zone content scaffolding (`zone.content = { resourceNodes, entities, pois }`)

**0.0.70e’s mission:**

> **Build the Zone Content Generation System AND add the first real content (entities, resource nodes, POIs) across selected biomes/templates.**

This patch is foundational for future world interaction, resource systems, combat, and exploration depth.

# 1. Goals of 0.0.70e

0.0.70d has two main components:

---

## 1A — Build the Zone Content Generation System

The goal is to evolve the scaffolding created in 0.0.70c into a functioning system capable of populating zones with interactive content.

### Required Features

---

### **1. Add Spawn Table Definitions to ZONE_TEMPLATES**

Templates must support:

```js
entities: {
  common: [...],
  uncommon: [...],
  rare: [...],
}

resourceNodes: {
  common: [...],
  uncommon: [...],
}


pois: {
  rare: [...],
  ultraRare: [...],
}

// Comment from developer: Entities, resources and POI loot table will also make use of the grade systems for items looted (F0 -> S9).
Grades till be low in difficulty 0 and also depending on biome/era type. There will be different rarities to POIs. Some will be commonly spawned in zones, and some will be rare.
```

Templates will later include:
- biome  
- era  
- future difficulty / spawn scaling rules
- Locations (interactable objects that will transition the player to a smaller zone inside the zone).

---

### **2. Build Content Population Pipeline**

Implement:

```js
populateZoneContent(zone, template, rand)
```

Responsibilities:

- Read template spawn tables  
- Use deterministic seed-derived RNG (`tile.seed + "_content"`)  
- Scatter content across valid tiles  
- Respect rarity, weighted tables, biome rules, difficulty  
- Insert final results into:

```js
zone.content.resourceNodes[]
zone.content.entities[]
zone.content.pois[]
```

Each content entry structure:

```js
{
  id: "wild_boar",
  x: 12,
  y: 7,
  rarity: "common",
  state: {}
}
```
// Comment from developer: Entities needs a loot table too (not sure if this is mentioned anywhere).
---

### **3. Modify Zone Creation Flow**

After layout is generated:

**For generated zones:**
- Create layout  
- Mark locked regions  
- Initialize zone content structure  
- Populate content from template  

**For static zones:**
- Build tiles  
- Initialize zone content  
- Populate template-based content  

---

### **4. Deterministic Placement Rules**

Content generation must be deterministic across:

- saves/loads  
- revisits  
- same world seed  

Use:

```js
const rand = createSeededRandom(tile.seed + "_content");
```

This ensures layout and content use separate random streams.

---

### **5. Spawn Constraints**

Rules for content placement:

#### **Resource Nodes**
- Only on walkable tiles  
- Avoid locked region tiles  
- Don’t overlap with POIs or entities  

#### **Entities**
- Use rarity-weighted selection  
- Difficulty scaling affects which entities appear  

#### **POIs**
- Common to Very rare  
- Avoid spawning near zone entrance  

These layers will grow in future patches.

---

## 1B — Populate Zones with FIRST CONTENT

0.0.70d must also include a small, usable content pack so the system can be tested in-game.

Only **Primitive Era + Temperate Forest / Cave / Whatever** biomes need content initially.

---

### **1. Resource Nodes (Primitive Temperate Forest)**

Examples:
- Berry Bush  
- Fallen Branch Pile  
- Stone Shard Deposit  

Each defines:
- rarity  
- interaction placeholder  
- tile footprint (1x1)
- grade (This will determine what grade the items will have that you get from the nodes). 
  Later on we will develop a formula and success/fail system for improvement of the node that will
  determine the item grade, but for now in short term we will just roll it randomly, with low grade
  being more likely to generate in low difficulty zones, and higher grades in higher difficulty zones.

---

### **2. Entities**

#### Passive creatures:
- Deer  
- Forest Hare
- Squirrel 

#### Aggressive creatures:
- Wild Boar  
- Cave Spider
- Wolf 

Each should define:
- aggression flag (0 = Completely neutral (not able to attack) -> 10 (Super aggressive, will attack on sight). 
- placeholder stats (HP, damage)  
- spawn rarity  
- biome + difficulty gating  

---

### **3. POIs**

**Primitive Forest POIs:**
- Mossy Shrine  
- Broken Obelisk  
- Abandoned Camp  

**Primitive Cave POIs:**
- Collapsed Tunnel  
- Old Lantern Circle  

POIs will become the foundation for quests, lore, puzzles later.

---

# 2. Technical Implementation Requirements

---

## **2.1 Extend ZONE_TEMPLATES (zones.data.js)**

Templates must define:

```js
difficulty
entities: { common, uncommon, rare }
resourceNodes: { common, uncommon }
pois: { rare, ultraRare }
```

Later additions:

- biome  
- era  
- environmental conditions  
- loot tables  

---

## **2.2 Extend initializeZoneContent (zones.core.js)**

Responsibilities:

- Ensure `zone.content` exists  
- Derive zone template from `def.templateId`  
- Create deterministic RNG  
- Call `populateZoneContent(zone, template, rand)`  

---

## **2.3 Create zones.content.js**

Create new file:

```
scripts/zones/zones.content.js
```

Contains:

- rarity weighting helpers  
- deterministic random utilities  
- tile filtering helpers (walkable tiles, avoid entry tile, etc.)  
- entity/node/POI placement functions  
- main dispatcher: `populateZoneContent(zone, template, rand)`  

This keeps the code modular and prevents `zones.core.js` from becoming bloated.

---

## **2.4 Integrate Into Zone Creation Pipeline**

---

### Generated zones:

```js
zone = createZone(...)
markZoneLockedSubregionsFromLayout(zone)
initializeZoneContent(zone, def)
populateZoneContent(zone, template, rand)
```

### Static zones:

```js
zone = createZone(...)
initializeZoneContent(zone, def)
populateZoneContent(zone, template, rand)
```

---

# 3. Deliverables for 0.0.70e

---

## **Code Deliverables**
- Extended `ZONE_TEMPLATES`  
- New `zones.content.js` module  
- `populateZoneContent` pipeline  
- Updated zone creation pipeline  
- Biome + difficulty-aware spawn logic  
- Deterministic content generation  

---

## **Content Deliverables**

### Primitive Temperate Forest:
- 3 resource nodes  
- 4 starter entities  
- 2–3 POIs  

### Primitive Cave:
- 2 resource nodes  
- 3 cave creatures  
- 1–2 cave POIs  

These are placeholders but fully functional within the system.

---

# 4. Non-Goals (Explicitly Not in 0.0.70e)

- Combat  
- AI  
- Harvesting / interaction mechanics  
- POI mechanics  
- Respawn rules  
- Loot tables  
- Saving per-zone state  
- Pathfinding  

These will come later.

---

# 5. Summary

Version **0.0.70c** established the world-slot + template generation foundation.  
Version **0.0.70e** builds the **content ecosystem layer** and populates the first zones.

This patch transitions ProgressCrawl from generating “empty caves” into generating **living ecosystems** with entities, resources, and landmarks.

EXTRA NOTES FROM DEVELOPER:
- We need to add randomized min/max width and height and randomized fillChance in Zone Templates for variations.
  In the future we will revise this depending on what type of zone it is (Caves should be more pathway-like while plains should be more open etc).
- Resource Nodes, Entities etc will spawn with a random grade system (F0 -> S9). This grade system will determine the grade on the items/loot the player will get from the node/entity.
  In the future, we will implement a system where the player can "improve" the node/loot before adding it to the inventory. There will be a "roll" function and then success/fail will
  be determined based on the characters skills and knowledge in the entity, resource type, life skill (mining, foraging, skinning whatever) and tool qualities etc. We need to
  keep this in mind when we're developing so we don't add other stuff that contradicts/collide with this vision.
