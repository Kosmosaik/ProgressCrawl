# ProgressCrawl – Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the upcoming planned versions of ProgressCrawl.  
It focuses on expanding core gameplay systems in the most logical order, ensuring each new feature builds cleanly on top of existing foundations.

This roadmap is flexible and will evolve as development continues.

---

## v0.0.66 — Polish & Stability Update
Small but important improvements

### Planned:
- UI consistency pass (button styles, panel spacing, tooltip clarity)
- Improve layout logic for Inventory/Equipment/Skills panels when resizing web page.
  Game looks awful on mobile (both portrait and horizontal mode). Try to improve this and come up with a system that will work on future features and panels etc.
- Add more settings and variables to config.js if possible.
- Refactor code and create new scripts to move code and make the project more modular.

---

## v0.0.67 - Inventory improvements
A small update to improve inventory UI and create more options for the player

- Add a toggle to collapse/expand all inventory categories at once
- Add a toggle to remove categories and keep all items (no matter category) in a single list.
  Add sorting option for category (inside "all items list"-view) and keep the other sorting options for new view.
- Add stats in tooltip for "actual stats" that the player will get by equipping an item.
  In other words, there will be "Weapon stats - Comparison with equipped item - characters stats after equipping the item".

---

## v0.0.68 - Level / Experience and armor improvements
- Add Level stat and experience points.
- Make a temporary easy exp formula for exp to next level etc
- Add a "Give EXP" button for testing purposes
- Add a text field to input how much exp to give character per click
- Add a "Give level" button for testing purposes
- Give character 3 attribute points to distribute on level up.
- Add defense values and other stats to armor/equipment.

---

## v0.0.70 — Zones & Exploration (Phase 1)
Unlocks real gameplay beyond clicking “Loot”. Exploring

### Planned:
- Add “Zones” (locations the player can visit)
- Each zone has:
  - Level range / Difficulty system (we need to discuss this a lot to find a good balance).

- Zone unlock progression.
- Starting Zone that the player will begin in. This zone will contain all the tutorials and we will focus on expanding this zone first after the world map and starting zone has been implemented.

### UI:
- New Zone selection panel (World map)
- Zone descriptions
- Zone completion time bar (similar to loot bar), going from 0% to 100%. During this time resource nodes, entities, POIs, Locations etc will pop up in a list that you can interact with.
- World map -> Zone -> World map transition
- Zone "finished" screen when clicking a button "Exit Zone" when 100% explored. Brings you back to the world map.

## v0.0.80 — Combat v1
The first real combat mechanics appear.

### Planned:
- Basic enemy system
- Simulation-style combat:
  - Player Attack vs Enemy Defense
  - Enemy Attack vs Player HP
  - Attack Speed calculations
  - Sliders for counting down to attack etc
- Loot obtained from defeating enemies
- Weapon damage and skill levels fully matter
- Give EXP and skills to weapon, survival and what not.

### UI:
- Combat log
- Enemy card with HP and stats
- Reward screen after victory

---

## v0.0.90 — Gathering System v1
Introduces resource gathering

### Planned:
- Resource items from Resource Node.
- Basic crafting stations (campfire → forge → advanced forge)
- Crafting stats and quality bonuses
- Interactables can require specific tools to gather (Axe to cut down tree etc).

 - Resource Nodes (Player interacts - get resources from node)
       Resource nodes to add: "Fallen Branch Pile" (gives Twig and Wooden Branch), "Stone Cluster" (gives Small Stone), "Tall Grass Patch" (gives grass bundle and occasionally Plant Fibre), "Tree (Scarred)"(Gives tree bark and insect/bug(find use for it)", "Tree (Normal), gives wood log, woodern branch and           twigs (needs an axe for cutting down tree to get logs).
  - Resource Node grade (F0 -> S9). This will determine what grade the items will get (no longer rolling random grades on item. It will be decided based on grade when player finishes the gathering for that node".
  - Loot tables/pools for every resource node
- Gathering System: Player click on Resource Node -> Clicks on "Get resources" -> System calculates/rolling success or fail to improve grade. When x amount of fails hits -> Give resources to player (or you can choose to "finish now" and get current grade resources).

### UI:
- Gathering screen (Skill of gathering task (Digging, Foraging, Mining whatever), Knowledge of resource, loading screen/slider, current grade, max grade of node etc).
- List to keep all discovered resource nodes, entities, POIs etc that the player will interact with. When depleted, killed or interacted with, remove that from list etc.
