I have uploaded a ZIP. Extract it, then recursively open the full contents of every .js, .md, and .css file in all folders and subfolders, 
and load all lines into your working memory before doing any analysis. 
One of the .md files is written to guide your understanding of the project (0.0.70c-qol-exploration-summary.md) — read that file first and treat it as the authoritative overview for the entire project.

Perfect! What do you think of the projects code structure? Is it good? Anything to improve? Are the scripts too heavy in code so we need to modularize or refactor, or are we good to go with 0.0.70c?
