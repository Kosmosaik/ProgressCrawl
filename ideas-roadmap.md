1. Rarity animation: When the loot slider/progress is finished, if the item is higher than Common (Uncommon, Rare, Exotic etc), animate the slider with a pop up like effect,
   reset the slider and fill it again, but this time with the Uncommon color. If the item is of rarity higher than Uncommon, repeat the same process and change the color to the next rarity (rare or whatever).
   This adds a jackpot-like feel to the looting system. Also, this means we will have to generate the item before we do the first check, so the slider-change process knows how many times it will repeat the slider reset/color change.

2. Sort items by category (header, lines etc). Add category to hover tooltip.
3. Change quality drop weight based on tier letter AND tier number (F9 most common, S1 rarest).
