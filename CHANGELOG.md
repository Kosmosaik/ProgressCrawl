## v0.0.66 - Modularization & UI Foundation

### Refactors & Code Structure

- Split the previously monolithic `game.js` into focused modules:
  - `game.creation.js` – character creation logic (base stats, point spend, randomization, creation button).
  - `game.save.js` – save/load system, save list rendering, snapshot helpers.
  - `game.patchnotes.js` – patch notes panel + `CHANGELOG.md` fetch/parsing.
  - `game.screens.js` – simple screen state machine (`start` / `character` / `game`).
  - `game.loot.js` – loot flow, progress bar timer, stat rolling and item instance creation.
  - `game.ui.panels.js` – DOM lookups + button wiring for inventory, equipment, skills, HP bar and loot button.
- Slimmed down the core `game.js` so it now focuses on:
  - Character-derived state (`characterComputed`, `currentHP`).
  - Equipment helpers (equip/unequip → inventory, auto-save hooks).
  - Recompute pipeline (`summarizeEquipmentForCharacter` → `buildCharacterComputedState` → UI updates).
  - Rendering of the Equipment panel, Skills panel, HP bar, and character summary header.
- Kept all global behavior and data formats intact so existing saves remain compatible.

### Inventory & Equipment Stability

- Fixed category collapsing logic in the inventory:
  - Removed the old `collapsed` variable bug that caused JavaScript errors.
  - Collapsed categories now simply skip rendering their stacks, so categories no longer disappear or behave erratically when equipping items or toggling sections.
- Improved equip/unequip flow:
  - Unequipping via the Equipment panel cleanly returns items to the inventory and triggers a stat recompute.
  - Equip / Unequip both now hook into the shared auto-save path so equipment changes are always persisted.
- Fixed an issue where trashing items did not persist:
  - Deleting items from the inventory now correctly updates the save snapshot, so trashed items stay gone after reload.

### UI & Styling

- Extracted tooltip behavior into a dedicated `ui.tooltip.js` module:
  - Centralized tooltip creation, positioning and show/hide logic.
  - Inventory and equipment tooltips now share the same underlying system.
- Modularized the global CSS:
  - Replaced `main.css` with:
    - `styles/base.css` – global look & feel, start/character screens, save list, character creation, header/menu bar, patch notes modal, tooltip styling.
    - `styles/game.panels.css` – loot button, progress bar, HP bar, inventory panel, equipment panel, skills panel, rarity colors, unlock “glow” effect, and inventory row layout.
  - No intentional visual changes; this is a structural cleanup to make future UI/layout work (like resizable inventory and new views) easier.

### Notes

- No new gameplay systems were added in this version.  
- This update is focused on internal structure, stability, and preparing the codebase for upcoming updates.

---

## v0.0.65b - Inventory Category Fix
- Fixed an issue where collapsing an item category and then equipping a weapon or armor would cause all categories beneath it to temporarily disappear.  
All categories now stay visible and behave correctly when equipping, unequipping, or looting items.
- Added a few new items in preparation for exploration, gathering and crafting updates.


## v0.0.65 - Character & Combat Revamp

## New Features

### New Combat Calculation System (No combat gameplay though)
Combat has been fully rebuilt. Your character’s Attack, DPS, Crit Chance, Loot Find, and Max HP now scale from:
- Your weapon
- Your attributes (STR / DEX / INT / VIT)
- Your weapon skill levels (new)
- Bonuses from equipped gear

Progression is smoother, weapon upgrades feel impactful, and characters grow in a more meaningful way.

---

### Weapon Skill Levels
Each weapon type now has its own skill:
- Daggers  
- Swords  
- Axes  
- Bows  
- Unarmed  

Higher skill → higher damage with that weapon type.  
Tooltips now show the exact skill requirement for each weapon (however, you can equip any weapon no matter your skills).

---

### Skills Menu Added
A new **Skills** button is now available in the main UI.  
You can view (and for now manually adjust) your weapon skill levels.  
In future updates, skills will increase naturally through gameplay.

---

### Character Sheet Overhaul
The Equipment screen now functions as the full **Character Sheet**.  
It displays:
- Total attributes  
- Max HP  
- Attack  
- Attack Speed  
- DPS  
- Crit Chance  
- Loot Find  

These update instantly when equipping or unequipping items.

---

### HP Bar
A new HP bar has been added below the loot button.  
It shows your current and maximum HP at all times.

---

## Improvements

### Enhanced Weapon Tooltips
Weapon tooltips now include:
- Damage  
- Attack Speed  
- Raw DPS  
- Required skill and your current skill  
- All rolled stats  
- + / – comparison against equipped weapon  

Inventory and equipment tooltips now match in style and information.

---

### Cleaner Inventory Experience
- **Equip** is now on the left; **Trash** on the right.
- Stack headers (e.g., *“Simple Dagger x4”*) no longer show tooltips.
- Only individual items inside the stack show detailed info.
- Sorting updated so **highest-grade items appear first**.

---

## Fixes
- Various minor UI cleanup and consistency fixes.

---

## Balance Updates
- Unarmed and early weapons now scale more smoothly.
- A small base Attack value has been added so very early damage never feels too low.
- Starter weapons now feel more distinct and more rewarding than fighting unarmed.

---

Enjoy the update!

## v0.0.61 — Equipment & Stat Polish

### Added
- **Equip / Unequip flow**
  - Every equippable item in the inventory now has an **Equip** button in its row.
  - Equipped items show an **Unequip** button in the Equipment panel that sends them back to the inventory.
  - Equipping and unequipping immediately updates your character’s stats and is saved automatically.

- **Clear character summary in Equipment panel**
  - The Equipment screen now shows:
    - **Attributes:** `STR`, `DEX`, `INT`, `VIT` as `Total (bonus)` so you can see how much is coming from gear.
    - **Derived stats:** `Max HP`, `Attack` (based on current weapon or unarmed), `Crit Chance`, and `Loot Find`.

- **Equipment unlock flow**
  - The **Equipment** menu button is now **locked by default**.
  - It unlocks the first time you loot an equippable item (like a dagger or armor piece).
  - When it unlocks, it gets the same subtle glow + ring effect as the Inventory button to draw attention.

### Changed
- **Attack display**
  - The character summary in the Equipment panel now shows a single **“Attack”** value.
  - The label automatically reflects what you are using:
    - Unarmed → `Unarmed Attack`
    - Weapon equipped → `Attack (using that weapon)`
  - This keeps the UI cleaner and focused on the attack that actually matters for your current setup.

- **Attribute bonuses from gear**
  - Items that grant attribute bonuses (for example, **Bark Chest** with bonus VIT) now:
    - Properly add to the attribute totals (e.g. VIT).
    - Correctly increase **Max HP** based on the new VIT value.
  - The summary shows this as `Total (bonus)`, for example: `VIT: 12 (2)`.

- **Inventory & equipment layout**
  - The **Inventory** and **Equipment** panels are now aligned side by side from the top,
    so they feel like one combined character screen.
  - The **Equip** and **Trash** buttons are grouped together on the **right side** of each item row, 
    making actions more consistent and easier to hit.
  - The Equipment panel uses a tighter column layout, 
    so stat labels and values are closer together and easier to scan.

- **Item bonus stat presentation**
  - Item bonus stats (like crit and loot find) are now only shown when they actually roll a value.
  - If a stat rolls as `0`, it is **not** displayed on the item at all.
  - Tooltips and summary rows use nicer names instead of internal ones:
    - `critChance` → `Crit Chance`
    - `lootFind` → `Loot Find`
    - etc., via a shared label mapping.

### Fixed
- **Equipment bonuses not applying**
  - Fixed an issue where **VIT bonuses from armor** were not reflected in your character stats or max HP.
  - Equipped items now properly feed into the character’s computed attributes and derived stats.

- **Inventory / Equipment buttons after loading a save**
  - Fixed a bug where **Inventory** and **Equipment** menu buttons sometimes disappeared after loading a saved game.
  - The game now:
    - Remembers whether Inventory and Equipment were unlocked for that character.
    - Restores those buttons correctly on load.
    - For older saves without these flags, it intelligently infers unlocks from whether you have items or equipped gear.

- **Rarity weight safety**
  - Hardened the loot roll logic so it falls back to default rarity weights if the config is missing or invalid.
  - This prevents rare cases where item generation could break due to misconfigured rarity settings.

## v0.0.60 — The Equipment Update

This update introduces the first version of the equipment system, 
allowing your character to gear up, gain bonuses, and grow stronger based on what you wear. 
The character sheet has also been expanded with a proper overview of your stats and item effects.

### New: Equipment System
You can now equip items directly onto your character.

Available equipment slots:
- Weapon
- Chest Armor
- Leg Armor
- Footwear
- Trinket

Equipped items:
- Display in the new Equipment panel
- Show their rarity, quality, and stats
- Include a clear tooltip with an “Equipped” indicator
- Can be unequipped at any time


### New: Character Stats Overview
The Equipment panel includes a full character summary that updates immediately when gear changes.

Attributes:
- Strength (STR)
- Dexterity (DEX)
- Intelligence (INT)
- Vitality (VIT)

Each attribute shows:
- Total value
- Bonus gained from gear (for example: `STR: 12 (2)`)

Derived stats:
- Maximum Health
- Attack (Unarmed or Melee depending on your weapon)
- Critical Chance
- Loot Find


### Inventory Improvements
Inventory entries for wearable items now include an Equip button.

Features:
- Equip items directly from inventory
- Works correctly even when items are stacked
- Only one copy of an item is equipped or removed from the stack
- Inventory and Equipment panels can be open simultaneously


### Saving and Loading
Saved characters now remember:
- All equipped items
- All inventory contents
- Character attributes
- Feature unlocks (such as inventory access)

Loading a saved game restores your character exactly as you left them.


### Fixes and General Improvements
- Fixed equipping items from a stack removing more than one item
- Fixed incorrect stat calculations when loading or creating characters
- Improved button visibility logic for new and loaded games
- Improved tooltip formatting and consistency across both panels
- Cleaned UI layout to ensure Inventory and Equipment align properly
- Equipping armor now adds and calculate bonus VIT / HP correctly.
- Equip button moved to the right side right besides the Trash-button
  (make sure you press the right button since Trash doesn't have any confirm-system yet).

### Known Errors/Bugs:
- Attack stat doesn't take item damage into consideration.
  (This will be fixed in the revised Attack/Damage/Skill system).
-

### Coming Soon
Work has begun on a revised Attack and Damage system:

- Weapons will have both “maximum potential damage” and “your actual damage”
- Skills will determine how effectively you can use different weapon types
- Attack will represent expected average performance rather than raw stat values
- Unarmed combat will be treated as its own weapon class

This foundation is now in place for the next major update where we will revise the damage/attack calculations.

## v0.0.57 (WIP) – Equipment panel & character summary

### Added
- New Equipment menu button next to the Inventory button on the game screen.
- New Equipment panel displaying:
  - Equipped slots: Weapon, Chest, Legs, Feet, Trinket.
  - Per-slot item names with quality and rarity coloring.
  - `[Unequip]` button per slot which returns items to the inventory.
- Character summary in the Equipment panel:
  - Attributes shown as `TOTAL (bonus)` for STR, DEX, INT, VIT.
  - Derived stats:
    - Max HP
    - Active Attack (Melee/Ranged/Unarmed)
    - Crit Chance (%)
    - Loot Find (%)

### Changed
- Equip buttons now share styling with Trash buttons for visual consistency.
- Inventory unlock now also reveals the Equipment button and allows both panels
  to be open at the same time.

### Notes
- Tooltips for equipped items match inventory tooltips but include an
  additional “Equipped” label under the Quality line.

---

## v0.0.56 (WIP) – Equipment saving and core equip flow

### Added
- Save system now persists equipped items:
  - `saveCurrentGame()` stores `equipped` using `getEquippedSnapshot()`.
  - `loadSave()` restores equipment with `loadEquippedFromSnapshot()` if present.
- New helper in `inventory.js` (conceptually):
  - `getEquipSlotForItem(item)` – resolves which slot an item belongs to (e.g. weapon).
  - `equipOneFromInventory(stackKey, itemIndex)` – equips a single instance from
    a stack, removes it from inventory, and returns previously equipped items
    back into the inventory.

### Changed
- Starting a new game now clears equipped items via `loadEquippedFromSnapshot(null)`.
- After loading a save, character stats are recomputed based on both attributes
  and equipped items.

### Notes
- Equip button UI is partially planned: one Equip button per rolled item line
  next to the Trash button. The actual Equipment panel and Unequip buttons will
  be added in the next steps.

---

## v0.0.55 (WIP) – Weapon item extensions

### Added
- Added `slot: "weapon"` and `attackType: "melee"` to Rusty Dagger and Simple Dagger.
- Added randomized weapon stats for both daggers:
  - `critChance` (in %)
  - `lootFind` (in %)
- These stats scale automatically with item quality tiers.

### Notes
- Damage and attackSpeed remain as before.
- Only weapons have these new properties; non-weapons remain unchanged.

---

## v0.0.54 (WIP) – Wire character & equipment math

### Added
- New `characterComputed` state in `game.js` to hold:
  - Base attributes
  - Total attributes (including bonuses)
  - Derived stats (Max HP, Melee/Ranged Attack, Crit Chance, Loot Find, Active Attack).
- Added `recomputeCharacterComputedState()` helper in `game.js` to:
  - Pull equipment bonuses via `summarizeEquipmentForCharacter()`.
  - Build the full computed state via `buildCharacterComputedState(...)` from `character.js`.
  - Log the result for debugging.

### Changed
- After creating a new character and starting the game, the character's full
  computed state is now recalculated once and logged to the console.

### Notes
- No visible UI changes yet; the game should behave the same, but the console
  will now show the computed character stats after starting a new character.

---

## v0.0.53 (WIP) – Equipment core module

### Added
- New `equipment.js` module to manage equipped items and their bonuses.
- Defined equipment slots for v0.1:
  - `weapon`, `chest`, `legs`, `feet`, `trinket`.
- Added helpers:
  - `equipItemToSlot(slot, item)` – equips a (copied) item into a slot and returns the previously equipped item.
  - `unequipSlot(slot)` – clears a slot and returns the unequipped item.
  - `getEquippedSnapshot()` / `loadEquippedFromSnapshot(snapshot)` – serialize and restore equipped items for saving/loading.
  - `summarizeEquipmentForCharacter()` – aggregates attribute and stat bonuses
    and detects the weapon's attack type for the character calculations.

### Notes
- Attribute bonuses (STR/DEX/INT/VIT), HP bonuses, and direct melee/ranged attack
  bonuses are supported in the data model but currently default to 0 until we
  add items that provide these stats.
- Crit chance and Loot Find bonuses will be drawn from item `stats` values
  (e.g. `stats.critChance`, `stats.lootFind`) when we extend weapon items.


## v0.0.52b (WIP) – Character math module

### Added
- New `character.js` module to centralize all character calculations:
  - Extracts base attributes from the current character.
  - Combines base attributes with bonus attributes from equipment/buffs.
  - Computes derived stats:
    - Max HP
    - Melee Attack and Ranged Attack
    - Crit Chance (%)
    - Loot Find (%)
    - Active Attack, which switches between:
      - `Attack (Melee)` when wielding a melee weapon
      - `Attack (Ranged)` when wielding a ranged weapon
      - `Unarmed Attack` when no weapon is equipped
- Added `buildCharacterComputedState(character, equipmentSummary)` as the
  main helper to get:
  - Base attributes
  - Attribute totals + bonuses
  - All derived stats in one object.

### Notes
- All values remain full-precision floats; rounding/formatting to two decimals
  will be handled in the UI layer later.
- Equipment bonuses are wired via a generic `equipmentSummary` object, which
  will be implemented in the upcoming `equipment.js` module.

---

## v0.0.52 (WIP) – Character config groundwork

### Added
- Added `GAME_CONFIG.character` with tunable values for:
- Base HP and HP per VIT.
- Base crit chance and crit per DEX.
- Loot Find gained per INT.
- Attack scaling factors for melee and ranged builds.
- Added `GAME_CONFIG.loot.rarityWeights` and `GAME_CONFIG.loot.lootFindBias` to centralize
  rarity weights and control how Loot Find subtly biases rarities.

### Changed
- Updated header text and internal version number from v0.0.51 to v0.0.52 for the
  character/equipment branch.

---

## v0.0.51 — Quality tweaks & Polish

### Added
- Reworked the item quality system. Quality now ranges from **F0** (worst) to **S9** (best),
  replacing the old F9 → S1 format so that higher numbers always represent better quality within a tier.
- Updated all quality-based calculations and sorting to use the new F0–S9 ladder, keeping stat multipliers smoothly scaled from low to high quality.

---

## v0.0.50 — Character System & Save Slots

### Added
- **Complete Character Creation System**
  - Players can create unique characters with custom or randomly generated names.
  - Classic stat system implemented: STR, DEX, INT, VIT.

  - **Game Screen**: Displays loot button, inventory, and character summary.

- **Character Summary Bar**
  - Shows current character name and stat overview (STR/DEX/INT/VIT) during gameplay.

- **Feature Unlock Persistence**
  - Inventory unlock state is now saved per character.
  - Ensures the UI behaves consistently when loading existing characters.

- **Menu Bar Framework for Future Features**
  - Inventory button moved into a top menu bar.
  - Supports seamless future additions such as Equipment, Crafting, Skills, etc.

- **Patch Notes Button**
  - Added a “Patch Notes” button in the header that opens an in-game panel showing the latest version changes.
